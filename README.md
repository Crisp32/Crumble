### How To Play
The goal of Crumble is to be the final player standing. Parts of the level around you will crumble periodically indicated by a flashing red square.

Players have the ability to fire rocket projectiles at certain angles. Upon impact, a rocket will knock them back as well as cause nearby tiles to instantly be destroyed. If a rocket hits a player, it will deal knockback as well destroy nearby tiles.

In terms of elimination. You can die by either falling through a crumbled tile or by falling off the edge of the map.

### Note
All of the logic behind this code was written in 2020 so its pretty ugly. It was only slightly re-organized recently.
