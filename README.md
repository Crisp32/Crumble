A top-down view web game where you must battle another opponent with a rocket launcher on a crumbling map.

# Tools Used
 - React for the client
 - Node.js for the server
   - Socket.io used to communicate between clients

*Used to be deployed on Heroku but I am not going to pay to keep it up as this was developed in 2020*
